Project Title: Interactive Quiz Application

---

Objective:
The Interactive Quiz Application aims to provide an engaging and interactive user experience where individuals can test their knowledge across various subjects. The primary objectives of the project are:

- Dynamic Question Loading: The app dynamically loads questions from a predefined set and allows the user to answer them interactively.
- Instant Feedback: After each answer, users receive instant feedback on whether their response is correct or incorrect, enhancing learning.
- Real-time Scoring: The app tracks the user's score throughout the quiz and displays it in real-time, allowing users to track their progress.
- Engaging End Screen: Upon completion of the quiz, users are shown a dashboard-style screen with their final score and an appropriate congratulatory message based on their performance.
- Responsive and User-Friendly Interface: The application is designed with a polished and vibrant UI/UX, making it visually appealing and easy to navigate across devices.

Features:
1. Dynamic Question Flow:
   - Questions are loaded dynamically, and users can navigate through them easily.
   - Each question has multiple choice answers, and only one correct option.

2. Instant Feedback Mechanism:
   - After every answer, users receive feedbackâ€”either confirming the answer as correct or incorrect.
   - The feedback helps users learn and track their knowledge.

3. Real-Time Scoring:
   - The score is updated in real-time as users proceed through the questions.
   - The final score is displayed at the end of the quiz.

4. Symmetric Answer Layout:
   - Answer options are presented in a grid layout (two options per row) for a clean and organized user interface.

5. End Screen with Dashboard:
   - A user-friendly end screen that shows the final score and a personalized message based on the performance.
   - Users can restart the quiz and challenge themselves again.

6. Polished User Interface:
   - Vibrant, modern colors and layouts make the quiz visually appealing.
   - Ensures accessibility with high contrast for readability (black text for questions and instructions).

Technologies Used:
1. HTML5: The basic structure of the application, including elements for displaying questions, options, and feedback.
2. CSS3: Styling and layout of the elements, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly interface.
3. JavaScript: Handles the dynamic content loading, quiz logic, scoring, and feedback system.

Implementation Details:

1. Question and Options Data:
   - Questions are hard-coded in a JavaScript array with options and correct answers.
   
   Example:
   ```javascript
   const questions = [
       {
           question: "What is the capital of France?",
           options: ["Berlin", "Madrid", "Paris", "Lisbon"],
           correct: 2 // Index of the correct option
       },
       {
           question: "Which planet is known as the Red Planet?",
           options: ["Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn"],
           correct: 1
       }
   ];
   ```

2. Quiz Flow:
   - Upon clicking the "Start Quiz" button, the quiz starts, and the first question is displayed.
   - The user selects an answer, receives feedback, and the next question appears.
   - After the last question, the end screen is displayed, showing the final score and a personalized message.

3. Score Handling:
   - A score counter is maintained throughout the quiz and updated after each correct or incorrect answer.

4. End Screen Logic:
   - After the quiz is completed, the end screen displays the final score with personalized feedback:
     - Perfect Score: "Excellent work! You got a perfect score!"
     - Above Average: "Great job! You did well!"
     - Below Average: "Good try! Keep practicing!"
   
5. User-Friendly Design:
   - Buttons are styled with hover effects to provide a modern touch.
   - A grid layout for the options makes the answer choices easy to read and select.
   - The final screen is designed as a dashboard with clear visibility of the score and a restart button for the next quiz.

End Screen Example:

The end screen congratulates the user with a final score and encourages them to either retry the quiz or exit. For example:

```html
<div id="end-screen">
    <div class="dashboard">
        <h1>Congratulations!</h1>
        <p id="final-score">Your final score is: 4 out of 5</p>
        <p id="end-message">Great job! You did well!</p>
        <button onclick="restartQuiz()">Restart Quiz</button>
    </div>
</div>
```

UI/UX Design:

- Color Scheme: 
  - A vibrant gradient background with greens and blues for an energetic vibe.
  - Buttons and feedback messages are styled with contrasting colors (green for correct answers, red for incorrect).
  - End screen uses a white background for clarity with a colorful heading for emphasis.

- Typography:
  - The primary font is Arial, which is clean and readable.
  - Headings have a bold and larger font size, with paragraph text slightly smaller for a visual hierarchy.
